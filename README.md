# Welcome

So, you've decided to try Codefresh? Welcome on board!

Using this repository we'll help you get up to speed with basic functionality such as: *compiling*, *testing* and *building Docker images*.

This project uses `Node.js` to build an application which will eventually become a distributable Docker image.

## Looking around

In the root of this repository you'll find a file named `codefresh.yml`, this is our [build descriptor](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml) and it describes the different steps that comprise our process.
Let's quickly review the contents of this file:

### Compiling and testing

To compile and test our code we use Codefresh's [Freestyle step](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/steps#section-freestyle).

The Freestyle step basically let's you say "Hey, Codefresh! Here's a Docker image. Create a new container and run these commands for me, will ya?"

```
     unit_tests:
          title: Unit Tests
          image: ${{build_step}}
          fail_fast: false
          commands:
            - npm test
```

The `image` field states which image should be used when creating the container (Similar to Travis CI's `language` or circleci`s `machine`).

The `commands` field is how you specify all the commands that you'd like to execute

### Building

To bake our application into a Docker image we use Codefresh's [Build step](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/steps#section-build).

The Build is a simplified abstraction over the Docker build command.

```
     build_step:
         title: Build
         type: build
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
         image_name: codefresh/demochat
```

Use the `image_name` field to declare the name of the resulting image (don't forget to change the image owner name from `codefreshdemo` to your own!).

### Launching

This is where it gets real! Let's use Codefresh's [Launch Composition step](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/steps#section-launch-composition) to run our composition within Codefresh!

Launching compositions within Codefresh means you have your very own staging area, at a click of a button!
```
     launch_composition:
       title: Launch Composition
       type: launch-composition
       composition: docker-compose.yml
       environment_name: 'node hello world'
       entry_point: web
```

Using the `composition` field, we direct Codefresh to the location if the `docker-compose` file in our repository.

Once the Launch Composition step has completed successfully, you'll be able to review and share your running composition in the [Environments page](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/share-environment-with-your-test).

Now that we've gotten a grip on the flow, let's get cracking!
